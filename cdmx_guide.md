# CDMX Tourist Guide (2025)

So, you are visiting Mexico City? Congratulations!, you are lucky, the city is one of the most diverse, fun and interesting places on Earth.

What do you need to know before visiting Mexico City.

Mexico City is a big city, 22 million people call it home. With a Human Development Index of 0.830, the city falls into the "very high" category. Its GDP per capita is over USD$30,000, making the city (besides São Paulo), the richest area in Latin America. With a high productivity services based economy, the city is by far the main country's economic engine. Financial, healthcare, business, logistic, software and retail trade are parts of the sectors in its economy. Recently, the city has become a center for the filming and entertainment industries.

Even when there is evidence of hunter-gatherers living near Chapultepec five thousand years ago, oficialy, the city was founded in 1325. So, this year we are celebrating its 700 anniversary. According to the legend, the Aztec people leave their land, Aztlán, to wander for decades seeking a new country for them (until today, nobody knows where Aztlán was). Hutizilopochtli, the Aztec god of the Sun, blood and war, told his people that they should found a new city where they watch an eagle eating a snake. They found the longed-for vision in the middle of a lake, in the Anáhuac Valley. Now the image is our national symbol.



"Chilango" is a Mexican slang demonym for natives of Mexico City. The average chilango has a college level of education. The city has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, even lower than Japan or Russia. For every four women in the city, only one would have a child. On the other hand, there is a big boom of pet related services. You'll see on the streets, the great number of dog walkers that work througout the city, many of them girls.

Administrativally, the city is divided in sixteen "alcaldías".



You can think alcaldias in a similar way that "Brooklyn", "Manhattan" or "Queens" are areas in New York City. For many years, the alcaldias were knowed as "delegaciones", the government changed the name to "alcaldia" a few years ago, but many people still use the old name. Every three years, people vote to elect a mayor for the alcaldia they live in. Every alcaldía is subdivided in "colonias", every colonia has its own Postal Code (CP). You can identify in what alcaldia, colonia and postal code you are looking in the street name signals:


Every alcaldia has a logo that identifies it. To increase your confusion, its necesary to clarify that, during most of the 20th Century, the city was known as "Distrito Federal" or DF (something similar to "District of Columbia" in Washington). Anyhow, in 2016 the city voted its first constitution and changed its name to CDMX. But many people still call it DF.

The mayor of the city is known as the "Jefe de Gobierno" ("Chief of government.") Currently, la jefa de gobierno is Clara Brugada.

The party in power is MORENA (Movimiento de Regeneración Nacional), a central left party. The president of the country, Claudia Sheibaum, and the majority in the national and local congresses, are also from that party. The conservative party is "Partido Acción Nacional" (PAN), it was in power from 2000-2012, but after two corrupt and ineficient administrations, people turned to the left.

If this all sounds complex, don't worry, as a first time visitant you'll be mainly in this area:


The area shows where most of the "must see" places in the city are located. Historically, CDMX has shown a strong sociallogical division between its West and East areas. Using the Zocalo as axe to divide the city, througout the centuries, the west has been the richest area. Typically, the fanciest neigborhoods are in this zone, while the East part of the city is poorer and uglier. The main reason for this division was the presence of the Texcoco lake, which produced unplaesent smells and mosquitos, but overall, to be near of the lake's shores implied a bigger risk of suffering a flooding. So, the rich families always prefered to build their houses in the west. The lake disapeared many years ago, but such sociological division remains nowadays, as you can see in the next map:

The iPhone cellphones (more expensives and in red color), are located in the west, while the east uses Android. The only redish point in the east is the AICM airport. As a first visitant, your only contact with the east part of the city likely will be coming and going from the airport.

# Where should I stay?

As a first time visitor, your options are esentially four: La Condesa, Roma Norte, Polanco and Coyoacán.

Condesa and Roma Norte are neigboorhoods that are next to each other, they are divided by one of the most important routes in the city, Insurgentes Avenue. So, both colonias share similar traits. Both were developed trying to emulate the parisian architecture and life. All the area is very walkable. You'll be surrounded for old Art Decó houses, modern brutalist apartments, big and old trees and many fashion stores, interesting restaurants, art galleries and tatoo shops. Those areas are famous for their intelectual life, so you'll see many writers, arquitects, film makers and artists chatting in the coffee houses.

Maybe you'd find Roma Norte an area where the hustle and bustle of the city feels more intensily than in Condesa. Also, Roma Norte is a couple of decades older than Condesa, so you'll find houses from around 1910. One of the greates advantages of this area, is its centric location. You can walk to many places (Chapultepec Park, Zona Rosa and Reforma Avenue are near), and the offer of public transportation is plenty.

Polanco is a place very different than Roma-Condesa, is one of the more richest areas in the city and over there, you can find Masaryk Avenue, the most expensive avenue in Latin America for square foot. Instead of bohemian cofee shops, you'll see expensive german car dealers and luxury fashion stores. It's a much more car centric area, with less apartmens and more big elegant houses. If you like the public display of social status, this is your place. But maybe I'm being unfair, a sunday evening in Polanco is delicious, the atmosphere is pretty much family based and many of the restaurants in the zone are superb. It deserves a shot. 

Coyoacán is a neigborhood located at the south of the city. One century ago was a small town, far away from the city, and even today such atmosphere is still there. It's Frida Kahlo's neigborhood, full of culture, museums and cobblestone streets. Near, you have Ciudad Universitaria, Mercado Coyoacán, Parque Hidalgo and Cineteca Nacional.

Those neigborhoods are just a small part of the city, there are many others interesting zones with its own history, character and charm. But, since this is your first time, they are a good place to start.

# What about the safety?

Even when in the global media, Mexico City is frequently represented with people running down the street engulfed in flames, the truth is that CDMX is actually a safe place. The main risks are pick pockets and people overcharging you in taxis or restaurants, but hardly you'd hear about a life threating situation. As in any big city, use your common sense. Don't go to sketchy neigborhoods alone and don't walk late at night in obscure streets.

Every year the city receives more than ten million of visitants, and most of them return to their place of origin without incident.

# Landing in CDMX

Mexico City has two airports, Bénito Juarez (AICM) and Felipe Ángeles (AIFA).

The AICM has two terminals, they are connected for a small and modern train that leaves every ten minutes on both ways. So, if you have scheduled your fly in T2, you can arraive to T1 and from there take the train using your boarding pass.

If you land in AICM, you can have several options to get to your hotel. The taxis in the airport are considered safe but expensive. There are frequent problems between the airports taxis and uber drivers. So, if you want to ask for an uber, you need to walk away a block from the airport, but the area is not so nice, so, is under your discretion.

# Getting cash

After landing, if you have your money in cash, you can use one of many Currency Exchange stores located in the airport. Usually, the stores in the airport have the best exchange rates. At the moment of writing this, you'd get $18.5 Mexican pesos for one dollar. The advice, is to exchange around $200 dollars ($3,700 pesos), that is more than enough for the next two days. After that you could use any ATM, in the city. Since most of the stores and restaurants in the city accept credit or debit cards, throughout your trip, you'd need to have around $2,000 pesos in cash in your wallet for the street food and thinks like that.

# Transportation.

Since Uber is abundant and cheap in the city, many tourist use it as their main way to move through the city. The advice here is to avoid to use local taxis (you'll recognize them for their pink color). The reason is because they are famous, even among the locals, to give a poor service and overcharge tourists. If you don't have any option but take a taxi, always pay in cash, never gave the driver your credit card, they are very skillful at changing the agreed amount for the trip.

CDMX has a good public transportation system. Many first time visitors avoid to use it for safety reasons, but we think that is a mistake. You will save a lot of money, and over all, time, using the subway or the metrobús. If you avoid the rush hours, it can be even an interesting and pleasent experience.

In order to use the public transport, you need to acquire a "Tarjeta Multimodal" (Multimode Card). It costs $11 pesos and you can buy it in most of the machines in the metrobús stations. With the card, you can ride Metro, Metrobús, Trolebús and Cablebús. A trip in Metro has a cost of $5 pesos, Metrobús $6 and Cablebús $7. Most of the public transportation in the city works from 5:00AM to 12:30AM. Weekends from 6:30AM to 12:00AM.

# Ecobici

Besides those options, you can use your "Tarjeta Multimodal" to ride Ecobici. To do so, you'd need to download the "Ecobici" application in your cellphone, pay a plan with your credit card, link your Multimode Card serial number in the app and thats it! Put your card near the card reader and the bike will be unlocked.

Remember that your ride can't be longer than 44 minutes. If you want to use it the bike again, you'd need to dock it, wait two minutes and use the card reader again. There is no limit in the number of times you can use a bike.

# Internet

There are many internet providers in CDMX (Telcel, Movistar, Virgin, etc.). However, your best option is to get an eSim in your cell phone. Try to chek prices and hire a plan before your trip.

Besides that, there is free wifi in most of the public transportation and many squares in the city. You can use it to save in your eSim plan.

# Night Life

The cuty has options for all the since neo-punk venues until tropical dancing clubs. Zona Rosa (Pink Zone), where the gay anmd pride movemetns were born in the city.
